IS A relation:
class extends class

class implements interface(s)

interfaces extends interface(s)

class extends class implements interface

in interface all variables are final by default

instance belong to an object
static belong to a class


abstract CANNOT be final!

throws handle an Exception
throw creates an Exception

Interface cannot inherit from a class!!

// by default
public abstract void downloadApp();

interface is a blueprint of a class

abstract class = super class
interface = supertype

POLYMORPHISM - different(multiple)+other = many forms
pre-condition of poly - there needs to be inheritance
Parent referents to child
ex:

ChromeDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
FirefoxDriver driver2 = new FirefoxDriver();

 WebDriver driver;  - one variable for diff objects
 driver = new ChromeDriver();
 driver = new FirefoxDriver();
