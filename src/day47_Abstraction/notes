Abstraction: concentration on essential/important things.
Hiding implementation and details of a method.

Inheritance is a pre-condition of an Abstraction!!


1. abstract class ABSTRACT keyword
2. interface


Regular class cannot have an abstract method!
Abstract class:
- cannot have any objects!!
Abstract method:
- does not have a body/implementation
- cannot be private, FINAL, static!!!
- no restrictions for return type

We CANNOT create an object of an abstract class!
We can implement abstract methods only through overriding
ONLY 2 ways to achieve abstraction:
- abstract class
- interface

Interface - a blueprint of a class. NOT a class!
Specifies the behavior/action that the class needs to implement

Abstract - a class
Interface - NOT a class

Interface - we can use only PUBLIC access modifier.
- 100% abstraction. Should be overridden

Interface cannot have Instant variables and methods.
By default in interface static and final

In lambda given variables are immutable

list.forEach(p->{  });
